    <h3><center>Difference Between Body and Univarsal selector(*)</center></h3>
    <pre><p>1. The body selector has highest priorty than the universal selector.<br>
        for example : I gave background color is red in body selector,
                                                 green in universal selector.
                 actually i get a green color has background color ,but it overrides and display body element background  color is red.
               all the styles will overrides the body selector. images, colors, fonts etc....

2.the body selector will displays the whatever write in with in the dody tag, but not get remaining elements aslo.

        for example:
                    I gave in foo word body tag with in body tag i used p tag and write some words,
                    after gave style background color is red in body selector but it not display p tag content. 
            in this case i use universal selector gave style background color is blue it will display all elements with in the body tag also.
               
            <span>so, the body selector has highest priority than universal selectorn and 
            it is applies style to only the body content, not within the body elements</span>
